I was born in Chicago to Lebanese and Egyptian parents, but grew up in London, England and Nice, France. So, at any given time, there were at least two languages going on at the same time — and up to five, depending on which aunt we were visiting.

I got into newspapers in a bit of a roundabout way. I wanted to be a writer/rock critic but always loved painting and drawing. I then taught myself Web design and how to use Photoshop before finally getting into newspaper design. And here I am, back in Web design and development.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

EXPERIENCE
I have 14 years of print design experience, 11 of which were spent at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, where I designed anything from 1A to Business covers to Arts & Entertainment covers and graphics.

I have also been designing web sites for 16 years – for fun, until a few years ago.

EDUCATION
I started my undergraduate education at EAI Tech, in Sophia-Antipolis, France, before transferring to the University of South Carolina’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication, where I earned my Bachelor’s degree.

I then jumped into the Missouri School of Journalism’s graduate program where I focused on design and earned my Masters in 2004.

In addition, I have a degree in Web Design from the Milwaukee Area Technical College and have finished a web development course in Chicago at Anyone Can Learn To Code.
